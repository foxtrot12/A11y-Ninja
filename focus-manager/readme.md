The Focus-Manager module is part of the `accessibilityUtilsTS` toolkit, designed to enhance accessibility in custom components with a focus on keyboard navigation and accessibility features. This module specifically addresses the management and handling of focus within web applications, ensuring a more accessible and user-friendly experience.

## Overview

The module comprises three main files:

1. **focus-manager.directive.ts**: This TypeScript file implements a directive for managing focus within components. It's a concise yet essential part of the module, aiding in the direct application of focus management logic in your components.

2. **focusManagerLogic.ts**: As the heart of the module, this file contains the core logic for focus management. It is more extensive and provides the foundational functionality upon which the other parts of the module rely. This file is essential for understanding the underlying mechanics of focus control within web applications.

3. **use-focus-manager.tsx**: Designed for React applications, this file provides a custom hook that integrates the focus management logic into React components. It's a straightforward and efficient way to leverage the focus-manager's capabilities within a React ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Directive-Based Focus Management**: Easily integrate focus management into your components with a simple directive.
- **Core Logic for Robust Focus Control**: The focusManagerLogic.ts file offers comprehensive solutions for various focus-related challenges in web applications.
- **React Integration with Custom Hook**: Seamlessly integrate focus management into your React applications using the provided custom hook.

## Specific Usage

### In Angular:
The `focus-manager.directive.ts` provides a directive to be used in Angular components:
```typescript
export class FocusManagerDirective
  constructor(private hostEl: ElementRef) {
```

### In React:
For React applications, `use-focus-manager.tsx` offers a custom hook:
```typescript

  const _subsManager: Subscription = new Subscription();
  const { onFocusIn, onFocusOut, onKeyDown, garbageCollector } = initLogic(
```

### Core Logic:
